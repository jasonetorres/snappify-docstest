# Image element

The image element allows you to upload custom images to your snap and adjust them in various ways. There's also a library of Static Images to quickly use commonly used images.

## Adding an image from library

Clicking the "Add Media" button will open a modal with different categories of handpicked images, such as Logos and Emojis.
Just click on the image you want to add and it will be added to your snap.

<Box mx="auto" maxW="600px">
  <NextImage
    src="/images/docs/editor/elements/image/static-images-tab-content.png"
    alt="Static images tab content"
    width={1818}
    height={804}
    quality={50}
  />
</Box>

## Adding a custom image

On the second tab you can upload your own image. Simply drag and drop the image to the upload area or click on it to open a file picker.

<Box mx="auto" maxW="600px">
  <NextImage
    src="/images/docs/editor/elements/image/upload-area.png"
    alt="Image upload area"
    width={1824}
    height={696}
    quality={50}
  />
</Box>

Below the upload area you can see the recently uploaded images. Clicking on one of them will add it to your snap.

## Right toolbar

Let's have a look at the right toolbar and what you can configure there.

### Image description

To ensure that your snap is accessible to all users, it's important to add a brief but descriptive text to the image.
This will be used as the `alt` attribute of the image when it is shared via a direct link or embedded on other websites.
On this way you can help users with visual impairments or those who use screen readers to understand the content of your snap.

### Replacing an image

You can replace any image on the snap by accessing the image categories on the right toolbar and selecting a new image from there.
By default the current selected image category will be expanded.

### Advanced Styles

The image elements supports the following advanced styles:

- Opacity
- Blur
- Rotation
- Tilting
- Border-radius (default: 8px)
- Shadow
- Grayscale
- Sepia
- Hue rotation

> **PRO Tip ðŸ’¡**
>
> To create more sophisticated designs, you can apply 3D rotation (tilting), to the image element.

## Element Tree (Left toolbar)

The image elements will be displayed with a small preview of the image itself.
If a description text is provided, it will be used as label for the element.
However, you can still [rename the element](/docs/editor/element-tree#rename-elements) by double-clicking it.

<Box borderX="1px" mx="auto" maxW="300px">
  <NextImage
    src="/images/docs/editor/elements/image/element-tree-view.png"
    alt="Element tree view"
    width={406}
    height={286}
    quality={80}
  />
</Box>
