# Video element

The video element enables you to embed a video from your preferred cloud storage provider into your snap. (Google Cloud, iCloud, Cloudflare, S3)

The main use case for this element is to play a video during a presentation. The video won't play in the editor, but as soon as you start presenting, the video will start playing automatically.

## Right toolbar

Let's have a look at the right toolbar and what you can configure there.

### Video duration

Since the video won't be played in the editor, you can see the duration of the video here.

### Replacing a video

You can replace the video by providing a new URL to the input field and pressing the `Replace video` button.

### Video description

To ensure that your snap is accessible to all users, it's important to add a brief but descriptive text to the video.
This will be used as the `aria-label` attribute of the video element when it is shared via a direct link or embedded on other websites.

This helps users with visual impairments or those who use screen readers to understand the content of your snap.

### Advanced Styles

The video elements supports the following advanced styles:

- Opacity
- Blur
- Rotation
- Tilting
- Border-radius (default: 8px)
- Box-Shadow
- Grayscale
