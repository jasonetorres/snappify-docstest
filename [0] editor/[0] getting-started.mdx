# Getting Started

The editor is the heart of snappify. Over the past year, it developed into a very powerful design tool that helps you to show off your code in a beautiful and professional manner. It has many functionalities you're used to from other design tools like Figma, but with first-class support for presenting code-snippets.

It lets you share your code snippets as static images, but also via [public URLs](/view/bcc54061-6e8f-44c5-a4f4-1abcad520108), which result in interactive code snippets where users can easily copy the code and paste it elsewhere. It even lets you [embed your snaps](/docs/embedding/getting-started) in the same interactive way. You can either embed them via an iframe on your personal website or on one of our supported embedding platforms!

## Examples

Take a look at some examples you can achieve with it:

<SimpleGrid align="center" columns={2} gap={8}>
  <NextImage

    width={400}
    height={242}
  />
