# Desktop App

Most of the snappify Features are available via the Web App and you don't need to install a native app for them to work. The only feature which requires the Desktop App is the [Video Export](/docs/slides/video-export).

Still, some people prefer a native experience on their computer and therefore snappify offers a Desktop Application for all major operating systems.

Here you can find the corresponding download links:

> Many of our users prefer the Desktop App for presenting their [Slides](/docs/slides). It allows you to present in full-screen on an external monitor while viewing your Notes on another monitor, making the presentation experience seamless.
