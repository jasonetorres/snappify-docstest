# Arrow Animation options

Here we'll discuss the different animation options available for the Arrow element. Be sure to also have a look at the [Animation Basics](/docs/slides/animations/basics) to learn more about our general Entry, Exit and Change animations.

After selecting an Arrow element on the Editor, you'll find the animation options on the **Animation** tab of the right toolbar.

## Draw Animations

For arrows, it's possible to choose "Draw" as the Entry and Exit animation. This will animate the arrow being drawn from the start to the end point of the arrow like you can see in the video below.

### Direction

For both the Entry and Exit animation, you're able to choose if the arrow should be drawn Forward or Backward.
