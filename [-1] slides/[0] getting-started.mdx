# Getting Started

snappify Slides enable developers to create impressive presentations and smoothly animated videos. Our platform offers:

- A powerful visual [Editor](/docs/editor/getting-started) for impactful slide design
- Rich-text, images, videos, arrows, and shapes integration
- Code snippet inclusion with various animation options
- Smooth out-of-the-box animations with customization options

Although you have the power to fine-tune animations to your liking, snappify Slides comes with smooth animations out-of-the-box. You can learn more about it on the [Animation Basics](/docs/slides/animations/basics) page.
