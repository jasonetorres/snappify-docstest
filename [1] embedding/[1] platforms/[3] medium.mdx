# Embed Snaps on Medium

Medium allows you to show code snippets in your articles, but let's be honest: they don't look very appealing.

With snappify you can embed your beautiful code snippets (+ also more sophisticated code explanations) directly on Medium. Those embedded snaps are fully interactive which means that your viewers can easily copy the code.

Here you can see an example article: [https://dominiksumer.medium.com/test-embed-snap-eaf46c32dfcf](https://dominiksumer.medium.com/test-embed-snap-eaf46c32dfcf)

## How to

The embed modal opens up and you have to select the "Medium" tab.

In the modal you can see a link which you can copy to your clipboard and head over to your article in Medium. Now it's as easy as pasting the link and type enter. VoilÃ¡: your snap is embedded on Medium ðŸ¥³
