# Integrations with other tools

Snappify enables you to create beautiful images of your code snippets for using them in marketing materials or educational content.

We strive to make it as easy as possible to create those materials and therefore enable you to do it directly from where you're writing your code: in your IDE.

Choose your favorite IDE below:

<Flex width="100%" justify="center">
  <SimpleGrid columns={[1, 1, 2]} gridGap={[5, 5, 5, 10]} width={['100%', '100%', '100%', '90%', '75%']}>
    <Card
      href="/docs/integrations/extensions/vs-code"
      bg="white"
      color="gray.700"
      caption="VS Code Extension"
      aria-label="Link to the VS Code extension docs"
    >
      <NextImage src="/images/landing-page/vscode-logo.png" alt="VS Code Logo" width={70} height={70} hideCaption />
    </Card>
    <Card
      href="/docs/integrations/extensions/intellij"
      bg="white"
      color="gray.700"
      caption="IntelliJ Plugin"
      aria-label="Link to the IntelliJ plugin docs"
    >
      <NextImage src="/images/landing-page/intellij-logo.png" alt="IntelliJ Logo" width={70} height={70} hideCaption />
    </Card>
  </SimpleGrid>
