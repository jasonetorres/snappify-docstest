# IntelliJ Plugin

Besides our Visual Studio Code Extension, we also created a plugin for IntelliJ based IDEs that helps you to create beautiful snippets from your selected code. You can find the plugin in the official [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20122-snappify).

If you find the time, it would be awesome if you can [leave us a review](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20122-snappify/reviews). ðŸ˜„

## Usage

Using the extension is as easy as selecting the desired code and right-click -> "Open in Snappify âœ¨". This will lead you directly to snappify where a new snap is being created using the code you've selected.

Afterwards you can use the snappify Editor to edit the snap to your wishes.

If you're not logged-in, it will replace your existing snap. If you're on one of our [plans](/pricing), it will be stored in an [auto-generated folder](/docs/dashboard#auto-generated-folders) so it won't pollute the root directory of your dashboard.
